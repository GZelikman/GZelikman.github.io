        <h1>Gym Diet Helper</h1>
        <p> <b>Keywords:</b> <span class="keyword1">Python</span> <span class="keyword2">Tkinter</span> <span class="keyword3">Project</span></p>
        <p>The Code of this project is on <a href="https://github.com/GZelikman/GymDietHelper_v1" class="pub">Github</a></p>
        <p> The Idea came for this project, because one of my Hobbies is powerlifting and bodybuilding, the combination is called powerbuilding <br>
            So my Idea was to have an application, in which I can track my weight, calories and more.</p>
        <p> In the end I created a program which takes input of weight, calories and burned calories daily, <br>
            also it takes the diet at input, which could be bulking, cutting or maintaining. <br>
            From these datapoints it gives tips for continuing your diet and also changes the daily calorie intake for you diet, <br>
            depending on your metrics. As an example if you are cutting and your calorie intake is under you given daily calorie intake, <br>
            but you don't lose weight, it will reduce the needed daily calorie intake.</p>
        <p>I first created an terminal based program, which work pretty nicely but isn't really comftable to use <br>
        So I tried customtkinter for the first time to create a GUI for the program. In the end I am happy how it turned out, <br>
        except I needed to use dialog boxes to get input and to show info, with that I am not happy and will probably change it someday.</p>

        <figcaption>The GUI of the application</figcaption>
        <p>As you can see on the picture, there are some buttons with diffrent fuctions, which explains them selfs</p>
        <p>For this project, saving the data is also an important feature, <br>
            so for this is used pickle for the first time, it is a great tool, to save Data locally.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>It was a fun project, which I will continue to work on, to make it better and more user friendly. <br>
            The features are not that important right now, I would like to make the GUI better and more responsive and get rid of the dialog boxes.</p>
        <h2>Changes to the project since this site is online</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New Button, to delete all data</li>
        </ul>
